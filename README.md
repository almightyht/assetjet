# AssetJet

AssetJet is a showcase application to prove that Python is a great choice for building production-level scientific applications.

AssetJet is also a demo of the following state-of-the-art libraries:

* sqlite3 (embedded database)
* Alembic (database migration)
* SQLAlchemy (object relational mapper)
* lxml (web scraping)
* NumPy/SciPy/pandas (data processing/scientific computing)
* Qt and PySide (GUI)
* Chaco (interactive charts)
* cx_Freeze and Esky (packaging and auto-update)

All this is based on open-source software that will work cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) out of the box.

AssetJet itself is a simple investment analyzer using historical time series from Yahoo! Finance.

This project also tries to shed light on the discussion of general-purpose versus domain-specific languages to build scientific applications (see e.g. http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/04/02/why-scipy/ ):

We believe that for building a fully-featured scientific application, Python is hard to beat.
